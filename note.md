# Design for Touch Devices

### When designing for touch devices, it is important to consider the size of the touch targets. Touch targets are the areas that respond to user input, such as buttons and links. If the touch targets are too small, users may have difficulty tapping them accurately.

### The Apple Design Handbook recommends that touch item on mobile devices be at least 44px by 44px.

### The Android Accessibility Guide suggests touch areas are at least 48dp by 48dp.

### The Android Accessibility Guide uses the term dp, which stands for density-independent pixels.

### Density-independent pixels are a unit of measurement that is used to ensure that touch targets are the same size on all devices, regardless of their screen resolution.
